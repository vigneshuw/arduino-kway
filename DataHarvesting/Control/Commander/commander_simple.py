# This scripts is the companion application for the DataHarvester sketch.
# It is a very basic application and can be improved and extended.
#
# It waits for user input to control the data acquisition operations and the
# connection to the Arduino board and to save the received data to a CSV file.
#
# It establish a serial communication to the board and uses COBS as enconding and
# reliable transport protocol.
#
# The main thread will always wait for user input while a second one is created
# to exchange both control and data with the Arduino board.
# The two threads coordinate via a simple Queue.
